# collab-calendar-remote
This is a tool that helps you to manage shifts on the Collaborative calendar.

The logic is contained within Javascript that can run on any device.  The JS reads from the clipboard and parses the data pasted from the Collaborative Google Doc.  You can then add/remove shifts. Once shifts have been modified, you can copy the text to be pasted back into the Google Doc.
This is a static website that is served by GitHub itself right from this repositiory!
